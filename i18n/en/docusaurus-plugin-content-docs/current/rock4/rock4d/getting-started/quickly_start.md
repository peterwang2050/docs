  :::

### System Startup Medium

Radxa ROCK 4D supports MicroSD card, NVME, UFS startup, but the quick start tutorial only introduces MicroSD card startup.

### Serial Debug

Radxa ROCK 4D mainboard supports serial debugging through USB serial data line, you need to connect the USB serial data line to the Radxa ROCK 4D's UART0_TX, UART0_RX and GND pins.

## Write System Image

You need to download the system image file to be written on the PC and burn it to the MicroSD card.

### Download System Image

Access the [Resource Download Summary](../download) page on the PC, download the system image compression package corresponding to Radxa ROCK 4D, decompress the system image compression package after downloading, and the `*.img` file obtained is the system image file to be written to the MicroSD card.

:::tip
The downloaded system image is a compressed file that needs to be extracted before being written to the SD card using the image burning software. Writing the compressed file directly to the SD card may result in write failure or boot failure.
:::

### Writing the System Image

Insert the MicroSD card into a card reader, then connect the card reader to a USB port on your PC.
