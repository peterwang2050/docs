  <summary>What is Maskrom Mode</summary>

    Maskrom mode, also known as Loader mode, is a special boot mode that generally used to recover or repair faulty devices.
    This mode allows the user to interact directly with the device's hardware without going through the operating system. In Maskrom mode,
    the user can communicate with the device through a computer or other device and execute a series of commands to fix the device's problems.
