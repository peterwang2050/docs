# Quick start

## Physical image

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-machine.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

To start the Radxa E20C, you need the following equipment:

- A 5V/2A power adapter (E20C can only be powered by 5V, you can use a PD power supply that supports 5V), For more details on power supply, please refer to [power-supply](./power-supply).
- A USB TYPE-A to TYPE-C cable to view log output and access the system.
- A network cable to access the system via ssh.

## Installing the operating system

Refer to the [Install System](./install-os/) section to install the operating system.

## Wiring and powering up

### Serial port access

1. Connect the TYPE-A port of the USB TYPE-A to TYPE-C cable to the computer, and the TYPE-C port to the Radxa E20C debug port, and set the baud rate to 115200.(the value of early OS image is 1500000,but it has some issues, if 115200 doesn't work,you can use 1500000 to try)

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-serial-login1.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

2. Plug the power adapter into the Radxa E20C's power connector. The device will power up and start, the system status light will be on.

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-serial-login2.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

3. After the system is up, the system status light will flash

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-power1.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

4. If you are on windows system, make sure the CH340 driver is installed on your computer.

Connect the TYPE-A port of the USB TYPE-A to TYPE-C cable to the computer, and the TYPE-C port to the Radxa E20C debug port, and check whether there is a CH340 driver in the device manager of the computer.

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-ch340-install.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

You can see the USB-SERIAL CH340 in the picture above, it means there is a driver, if not, please install the [CH340 driver](https://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html).

5. Use the serial port tool

### Windows

Putty is a serial port tool that can be used on Windows and supports multiple baud rates. Here is how to use Putty to connect to a serial port.

1. Download [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and install it. 2.

2. Plug the USB end of the USB to TTL serial cable into the PC and check the **Device Manager** to find the COM number. Here we assume it is COM3.

3. Open Putty and set it up as follows:

- Select Session in the left column, set the serial line to COM3, the baud rate to 1500000, and the connection type to Serial.
- Write radxa-e20c in the Saved Sessions column and press Save.

Press Save. [Putty](/img/common/putty/putty-rk-1.webp)

4. Select Serial at the bottom of the left column and configure it with the following parameters:

![Putty](/img/common/putty/putty-rk-2.webp)

5. After setting, click Open to open the serial port, make sure the TTL port is correctly connected, and then turn on the power of the motherboard.

### Linux

Minicom is a serial port utility that can be used on Linux and supports multiple baud rates. Here is how to use Minicom to connect to a serial port.

1. After plugging the USB port into the host PC, please find the serial device first:

Type `dmesg | tail` in the terminal and you will get a printout similar to the following:

```bash
[10.654076] usb 1-6.4.3: new full-speed USB device number 103 using xhci_hcd
[10.755730] usb 1-6.4.3: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=6001
[10.755732] usb 1-6.4.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[10.755733] usb 1-6.4.3: Product: USB <-> Serial
[10.755734] usb 1-6.4.3: Manufacturer: FTDI
[10.756728] ftdi_sio 1-6.4.3:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
[10.756750] usb 1-6.4.3: Detected FT232BM
[10.757195] usb 1-6.4.3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

According to the last line, **/dev/ttyUSB0** is the newly inserted serial device.

:::tip
There may be cases where you do not have permission to read or write to the serial port.

**Temporary solution: Modify the permissions with chmod command**.

```bash
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

**Permanent: add the current user to the dialout group** ``bash sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0\*\*.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

:::

2. Install minicom:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

3. Setting up minicom

First, add the current non-root or non-sudo user to the plugdev group.

````bash
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
``

Edit ~/.bashrc, add the following parameters, and reopen a new terminal.

```bash
alias minicom='minicom -w -t xterm -l -R UTF-8'
````

Create and edit the file ~/.minirc.1500000-usb0 to add the following:

```
pu port /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate 1500000
pu bits 8
pu parity N
pu stopbits 1
pu rtscts No
```

4. Execute the following command to connect the device, specifying the parameter 1500000-usb0 to use the above configuration.

```bash
minicom 1500000-usb0
```

2. Plug the power adapter into the Radxa E20C's power connector. The device will power up and start, the system status light will be on.

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-serial-net-login2.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

3. When the system is up, the system status light will blink and the WAN port light will also be on

<img src="/img/e/e20c/radxa-e20c-power2.webp" width="500" alt="radxa-e20c pack" />

4. Use Angryip to find IP

This method can be used to find IP address when you can't directly operate the motherboard to get no screen or remote IP address.

- First of all, the host needs to download [Angryip](https://angryip.org/download/), and then make sure the host and motherboard are in the same LAN.

- Open Angryip, select the IP range 192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.255 (select the network segment where the host computer and motherboard are located), click Start, as shown in the figure.

- ![Angryip](/img/configuration/ssh-Angryip.webp)

- Ctrl + F Look for the `2a` keyword to find the IP address of the motherboard.

  5.SSH connection to Radxa E20C

```bash
ssh [username]@[IP address] # or ssh [username]@[hostname]
```
